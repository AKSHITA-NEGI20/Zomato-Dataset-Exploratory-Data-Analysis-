# Zomato-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

The Zomato dataset provides a rich source of information for exploring the dynamics of the restaurant industry, including insights into customer preferences, dining costs, and restaurant ratings across various cuisines and locations. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. By employing various visualization techniques, such as bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, we will analyze key metrics such as average ratings, cuisine popularity, and the relationship between cost and customer satisfaction. This analysis not only enhances our understanding of the Zomato ecosystem but also highlights opportunities for growth and improvement within the restaurant sector.
